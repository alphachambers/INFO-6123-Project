**Design**
**CONTRAST** The design is kept minimal at all states. The primary colors are White, Grey (#242424) and Celery Green (#A1C45A). Sufficient contrast between the foreground and the backdrop is a crucial component of colour on the Web for users with limited eyesight as well as colorblindness. Black and white provide the highest contrast, but some people can find it too overwhelming (it might cause glare). So for this reason we have used Celery to reduce the glare.
**TYPOGRAPHY** To keep the design in it's minimal state we have used a combination of Serif and Sans Serif font. The fonts used are Playfair Display and Montserrat with different weights.
**BALANCE** We used the Symmetrical approach for the balance principle,everything on one side of the axis is mirrored on the other. The apparent weight is hence evenly divided. It gives the composition a stable appearance and an organised appearance.
**EMPHASIS** Emphasis Principle was used at several places in the design, for instance we changed the font weight for the text to grab viewer's attention.
**RHYTHEM** To keep the rhyhtem in the design, the spacing between different elements on all pages was kept constant.

**Accessibility**
_Use of Headers:_
Headers were used as a tool for structuring and organising content on a webpage. This makes it simple for all users to traverse the website.
_Alt tag for images:_
Assigning alt tags to images will therefore give users a description of the image so they can understand it when using a screen reader.
